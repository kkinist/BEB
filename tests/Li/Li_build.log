Li atom has only one valence electron.  In the frozen-core
approximation, it has only one electron and no correlation energy. 
Some post-HF calculations fail or give trivial results:
  * Li_cc1hi.gjf and Li_ept2.gjf are silly because triplet Li+ has no
    beta electrons, therefore no electron correlation (only exchange). 

One option is to parse only the Li_bu.out file (by deleting the others). 

Another option, taken here, is to include the core orbitals in the 
post-HF correlation treatments.  The basis set for CCSD(T) was changed
to cc-pCVTZ to accomodate core correlation. This basis set was obtained
from the PNNL/EMSL basis set library at https://bse.pnl.gov/bse/portal.
