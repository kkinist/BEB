Manual modification to ZnEt2_cc1lo.gjf because the following warning was
reported when running beb_g09parse.py:
*** Warning: Large difference of 1.93 eV between CCSD(T) and P3-3rd VIE values ***

Upon inspection, the EPT (P3-3rd) value of VIE was much closer to the experimental
value (found at http://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/) and was for an orbital of B 
symmetry (irreducible representation in point group C2). But the CCSD(T) calculation
for the doublet ion was for a state of symmetry A, an excited state.  

To fix the problem, I added a preparatory step to to follow any UHF instability.
This improved UHF solution was then read from the checkpoint file for CCSD(T). 

Another way to fix it would be to use the 'guess=alter' option.
