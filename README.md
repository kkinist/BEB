# BEB
Calculate electron-ionization total ionization cross sections for molecules.

1.  Starting from simple coordinates, input files are generated for the Gaussian09 quantum chemistry program (G09). 
You must have a license for G09 to get any results. 
2.  There is a shell script to run all the G09 calculations. 
3.  The resulting output files are parsed to create a 'BUN' file of molecular data. 
4.  The BUN file is processed to run the BEB calculation of total ionization cross section (electron impact). 
You can do this step (the actual BEB calculation) even without access to Gaussian09,
but you'll have to create the BUN file yourself. 

After downloading, please begin by reading the manual.
